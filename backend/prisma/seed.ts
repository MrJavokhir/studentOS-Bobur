Before anything else, make sure you have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. Practice on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

## 2. Build Real Projects
Employers want to see what you can build. Create a portfolio showcasing your best work, including personal projects and contributions to open source.

## 3. Practice Behavioral Questions
Technical skills aren't everything. Be ready to discuss your experiences, challenges you've overcome, and how you work in teams.

## 4. Research the Company
Understand the company's products, culture, and values. This shows genuine interest and helps you ask meaningful questions.

## 5. Follow Up
After the interview, send a thank-you email. It's a small gesture that can make a big difference.`,

Don't try to change everything at once. Pick one habit and focus on making it automatic before adding more.

Attach new habits to existing ones. "After I finish my morning coffee, I will study for 30 minutes."

## Track Your Progress
Use a habit tracker to visualize your streak. The longer your streak, the more motivated you'll be to maintain it.

## Embrace Imperfection
Missing one day doesn't mean you've failed. Get back on track the next day.

## Reward Yourself
Celebrate small wins. This positive reinforcement makes habits more likely to stick.`,
